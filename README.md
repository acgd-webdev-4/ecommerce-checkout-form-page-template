# Form page template

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `dog-rescue-pattern-library`*
- Using your previously designed patterns create the rescue application form page.
- Inside your `pages` folder make a new single HTML file—name it so that it matches your navigation.
- *You should only write HTML, copy-and-paste pattern code & insert appropriate classes like `.grid` and type sizes.*
- **This page does not get its own CSS file.** If you cannot create the page without writing CSS, your patterns aren’t good enough. Go back to the patterns and add variations. Or make a brand new pattern.
- Be sure to link every CSS file for all the patterns into the top of this single HTML. This is exactly why it’s super important that your patterns do not target HTML tags directly because at this point there **will** be collisions.
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
